PERSONSAL PROJECT:

I thought of an immersive and interactive digital art project to "intervene" in this phenomenon.A detailed project description is in the pdf.
When I want to take the project forward, digital platforms can be used to showcase our project. Through social media, websites and online communities, regular updates and behind-the-scenes stories about the project can be shared. Audiences are encouraged to actively participate in discussions and create an interactive community atmosphere.
Secondly, I will actively seek crowdfunding or investment opportunities through digital platforms. This will raise funds and garner support from more people or large institutions or organisations. Partnerships with relevant organisations and advocacy groups are the better outcome I can envisage. Through each other's networks and resources, we can extend the reach of the project and attract more attention and support.
